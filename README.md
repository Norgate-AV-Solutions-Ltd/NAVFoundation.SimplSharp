## Build :hammer_and_wrench:

Requirements:
1. Visual Studio 2008 Professional
2. [Crestron Simpl Sharp Pro with Simpl Sharp Library 2.000.0058.01](https://www.crestron.com/Products/Control-Hardware-Software/Software/Development-Software/SW-SIMPL-SHARP-PRO)

Due to the dependency of .NET 3.5 Compact Framework, this must be built with Visual Studio 2008 Professional. The non-Professional version will not suffice as far as I am aware. The Crestron SimplSharp plugin must also be installed. This is unfortunately not freely available to the general public.
